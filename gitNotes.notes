Git Overview: A Quick Reference
This guide summarizes key Git concepts, commands, and workflows that are essential for managing version control and collaborating on projects using Git and GitHub.

What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes in code and allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. Each user has their own local copy of the repository, which they can work on independently.
GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can host and share Git repositories for online collaboration.
Version Control vs. Distributed Version Control
Version Control Systems (VCS) like SVN are centralized, meaning a central server stores the code, and users access it over the network.
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git allow each user to have a full copy of the repository locally, enabling offline work.
Git Workflow
Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository:
Working Directory: Where you modify your files.
Staging Area: Files are added here before committing them to the repository.
Repository: The committed files are stored in Git's version control system.
Common Git Commands
git --version: Displays the installed Git version.
git status: Shows the current state of the files (e.g., modified, staged, or untracked).
git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
git add: Stages files to be committed (e.g., git add file.txt).
git commit: Commits staged files with a message (e.g., git commit -m "Added feature X").
git log: Shows the commit history for the current branch.
git branch -M <branch-name>: Renames the current branch (e.g., git branch -M main to rename to main).
Git Configuration (git config --global)
Configure user-specific settings like name, email, and default editor.
bash
Copy code
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
This helps identify who made each commit.
Working with Remotes
Remove Existing Remote:
bash
Copy code
git remote remove origin
Add a New Remote:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Push Changes to Remote:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
This pushes the local changes to the remote repository (origin) and sets main as the default branch.
Git Tags
What are Tags? Tags mark specific points in your project's history, such as release points (e.g., v1.0).

Create a Tag:

bash
Copy code
git tag v1.0
View Tags:

bash
Copy code
git tag
Push a Tag to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin v1.0
Git Clone
What is it? git clone copies a remote repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Authentication with GitHub
If you encounter the error:

vbnet
Copy code
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Prathapgithub1/RxseedBackend.git/'
Solution: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication instead of a password. Follow these steps:

Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub here.
Use your GitHub username and the generated PAT when prompted for a password during Git operations.
Branches in Git
What is a Branch? A branch allows you to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch. Think of it as a separate workspace.
Create and Switch Branch:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature1
This creates and switches to a new branch named feature1.
Switch to an Existing Branch:
bash
Copy code
git switch feature1
List All Branches:
bash
Copy code
git branch
Delete a Branch:
bash
Copy code
git branch -D feature2
This forcefully deletes the feature2 branch even if there are unmerged changes.
Merging Branches
To merge one branch into another:

Switch to the target branch:

bash
Copy code
git switch main
Merge the feature1 branch into main:

bash
Copy code
git merge feature1
Resolve conflicts (if any) and commit:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Merge feature1 into main"
Pull and Push Changes
Pull changes from the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Push changes to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature1
Summary of Key Concepts
Command	Purpose
git checkout -b feature1	Creates and switches to a new branch (feature1).
git switch feature1	Switches to an existing branch (feature1).
git branch	Lists all local branches.
git merge feature1	Merges changes from feature1 into the current branch.
git pull origin main	Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote main branch.
git push origin feature1	Pushes changes from your local feature1 branch to the remote repository.
Conclusion
This quick reference should give you a solid foundation for working with Git and GitHub, from basic commands to advanced features like branches, tags, and remote management.
